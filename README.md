# stack-with-linked-list

Implementation of a Stack using a Singly Linked List

16 functions for the class were implemented to interact with the stack, examples include:

- Push (function for adding elements to the top of the stack)
- Pop (function for removing elements from the top of the stack)
- Print (function for printing values of the entire stack)
- ToArray (function for returning the stack as an array)
- Min + Max (function for returning the minimum and maximum values of the stack, respectively)

Files included in the repository:
- main.cpp (main file where stack functions are tested)
- Stack.h (header file containing the class declaration of Stack)
- Stack.cpp (implementation file containing member function definitions)
